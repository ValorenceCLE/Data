# **Raspberry Pi Project**
This project focuses on data processing and automation using a custom circuit board with an embedded Raspberry Pi. This repository contains the R&D code built around the DPM (Dual-Purpose Modular) system.

## **Core Data Processing Logic**

The core of this project is the data processing logic, which handles automated data collection, alerting, processing, and actions. The system is designed to efficiently process large volumes of data and trigger appropriate actions based on predefined rules.

## **Automated Data Collection**

Data is collected automatically from various sensors and devices connected to the Raspberry Pi. The system supports multiple data sources and ensures that data is collected in real-time.

## **Alerting and Actions**

The system includes a robust alerting mechanism that notifies users of any anomalies or important events. Based on the alerts, the system can trigger specific actions to address the issues or optimize performance.

## **AWS Integration**

The project integrates with AWS services to enhance data processing capabilities and provide scalable storage solutions. AWS services are used for data storage, processing, and analytics, ensuring that the system can handle large datasets efficiently.

## **Configurable Runtime**

The runtime of the system is highly configurable through a frontend interface. Users can customize the data processing rules, alerting mechanisms, and actions using the frontend available at [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/ValorenceCLE/Frontend.git).
